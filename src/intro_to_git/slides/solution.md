Solution
========

- All solutions are connected to two key points:
    - Increase documentation
        - Label artefacts
        - Describe artefacts
        - Track artefact evolution
    - Increase redundancy
        - Keep copies of the artefacts (in their current state)
        - Keep copies of previous versions of the artefacts
        - Keep copies of documentation
