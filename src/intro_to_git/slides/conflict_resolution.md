Conflict Resolution
===================

- Conflicts happen when merging two files that were edited separately
- Git always tries to resolve conflicts automatically
- If it fails to do so, it will mark the conflict lines in the file

```````
<<<<<<<
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
=======
Nam fermentum tristique massa sit amet dictum.
>>>>>>>
```````

- After the conflicts are resolved manually, you can commit the changes
