Repository Directory Precautions
================================

- Some care should be taken when using the Git controlled repository directory
    - Git will overwrite files on certain commands
    - The idea is to restore the directory to its requested state
    - Uncommitted changes are lost
    - Git warns about any uncommitted changes on most cases
