Viewing the History
===================

- The `git log` command walks back through all commits starting from the current
  commit (HEAD)
- You can also specify which commit(s) it should start at
- Some useful options
    - `--oneline`: shows only the title of each commit
    - `--decorate`: adds branch and tag information
    - `--all`: starts at all tags and branches, showing all reachable commits
    - `--graph`: draws lines to represent the tree
