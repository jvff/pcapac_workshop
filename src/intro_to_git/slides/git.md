Git
===

- By Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux repository
- Decentralized
    - Every person (or computer) has a complete independent copy of the repository
    - Internet connection only used to synchronize repositories
- Manages versions of the artefact set as a whole
    - No need to manage versions of each artefact individually
- Designed to work better with pure text files
    - Some helper features don't work with binary files
