<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Git controls a directory that contains the repository
        <ul>
            <li>The <kbd>git init</kbd> command prepares a directory to be used
                as a repository managed by Git</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Inside the directory, a hidden <samp>.git</samp> directory is created
        <ul>
            <li>Stores copies of artefacts, meta-data and other internal files
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Git assumes ownership of the directory, and controls the artefacts
        stored in it
        <ul>
            <li>The <samp>.gitignore</samp> file can be used to tell Git to not
                treat certain files as artefacts
                <ul>
                    <li>Temporary files</li>
                    <li>Files that can be generated from the artefacts</li>
                    <li>Files specific to the local computer environment</li>
                    <li>Security-sensitive files (that store a password, for
                        example)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
