<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Short and specific commits are better to understand</li>
    <li>There are different usages for branches
        <ul>
            <li>You can create feature branches that are merged to a
                master branch</li>
            <li>You can always use rebases to write a linear commit history</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A version control tool does not solve the problem by itself</li>
</ul>
